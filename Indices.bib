  abstract = {We study the lobby index (l-index for short) as a local node centrality measure for complex networks. The l-index is compared with degree (a local measure), betweenness and Eigenvector centralities (two global measures) in the case of a biological network (Yeast interaction protein\textendash{}protein network) and a linguistic network (Moby Thesaurus II). In both networks, the l-index has a poor correlation with betweenness but correlates with degree and Eigenvector centralities. Although being local, the l-index carries more information about its neighbors than degree centrality. Also, it requires much less time to compute when compared with Eigenvector centrality. Results show that the l-index produces better results than degree and Eigenvector centrality for ranking purposes.},

  abstract = {The massive presence of silent members in online communities, the so-called lurkers, has long attracted the attention of researchers in social science, cognitive psychology, and computer-human interaction. However, the study of lurking phenomena represents an unexplored opportunity of research in data mining, information retrieval and related fields. In this paper, we take a first step towards the formal specification and analysis of lurking in social networks. Particularly, focusing on the network topology, we address the new problem of lurker ranking and propose the first centrality methods specifically conceived for ranking lurkers in social networks. Using Twitter and FriendFeed as cases in point, our methods' performance was evaluated against data-driven rankings as well as existing centrality methods, including the classic PageRank and alpha-centrality. Empirical evidence has shown the significance of our lurker ranking approach, which substantially differs from other methods in effectively identifying and ranking lurkers.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in network theory have allowed for the study of the structure and function of the human brain in terms of a network of interconnected components. Among the many nodes that form a network, some play a crucial role and are said to be central within the network structure. Central nodes may be identified via centrality metrics, with degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality being three of the most popular measures. Degree identifies the most connected nodes, whereas betweenness centrality identifies those located on the most traveled paths. Eigenvector centrality considers nodes connected to other high degree nodes as highly central. In the work presented here, we propose a new centrality metric called leverage centrality that considers the extent of connectivity of a node relative to the connectivity of its neighbors. The leverage centrality of a node in a network is determined by the extent to which its immediate neighbors rely on that node for information. Although similar in concept, there are essential differences between eigenvector and leverage centrality that are discussed in this manuscript. Degree, betweenness, eigenvector, and leverage centrality were compared using functional brain networks generated from healthy volunteers. Functional cartography was also used to identify neighborhood hubs (nodes with high degree within a network neighborhood). Provincial hubs provide structure within the local community, and connector hubs mediate connections between multiple communities. Leverage proved to yield information that was not captured by degree, betweenness, or eigenvector centrality and was more accurate at identifying neighborhood hubs. We propose that this metric may be able to identify critical nodes that are highly influential within the network.},

  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevE.85.066103},
  abstract = {Here we present a range-limited approach to centrality measures in both nonweighted and weighted directed complex networks. We introduce an efficient method that generates for every node and every edge its betweenness centrality based on shortest paths of lengths not longer than $\mathscr{l}$=1,...,L in the case of nonweighted networks, and for weighted networks the corresponding quantities based on minimum weight paths with path weights not larger than w$\mathscr{l}$=$\mathscr{l}\Delta$, $\mathscr{l}$=1,2...,L=R/$\Delta$. These measures provide a systematic description on the positioning importance of a node (edge) with respect to its network neighborhoods one step out, two steps out, etc., up to and including the whole network. They are more informative than traditional centrality measures, as network transport typically happens on all length scales, from transport to nearest neighbors to the farthest reaches of the network. We show that range-limited centralities obey universal scaling laws for large nonweighted networks. As the computation of traditional centrality measures is costly, this scaling behavior can be exploited to efficiently estimate centralities of nodes and edges for all ranges, including the traditional ones. The scaling behavior can also be exploited to show that the ranking top list of nodes (edges) based on their range-limited centralities quickly freezes as a function of the range, and hence the diameter-range top list can be efficiently predicted. We also show how to estimate the typical largest node-to-node distance for a network of N nodes, exploiting the afore-mentioned scaling behavior. These observations were made on model networks and on a large social network inferred from cell-phone trace logs ($\sim$5.5\texttimes{}106 nodes and $\sim$2.7\texttimes{}107 edges). Finally, we apply these concepts to efficiently detect the vulnerability backbone of a network (defined as the smallest percolating cluster of the highest betweenness nodes and edges) and illustrate the importance of weight-based centrality measures in weighted networks in detecting such backbones.},

While for sparse unweighted networks 1-spectral centrality behaves similarly to other standard centralities, for dense weighted networks they show different properties. In summary, the k-spectral centralities provide a novel and useful measurement of relevance (for single network elements as well as whole subnetworks) distinct from other known measures.},

  abstract = {The centrality of vertices has been a key issue in network analysis. For unweighted networks where edges are just present or absent and have no weight attached, many centrality measures have been presented, such as degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector and subgraph centrality. There has been a growing need to design centrality measures for weighted networks, because weighted networks where edges are attached weights would contain rich information. Some network measures have been proposed for weighted networks, including three common measures of vertex centrality: degree, closeness, and betweenness. In this paper, we propose a new centrality measure called the Laplacian centrality measure for weighted networks. The Laplacian energy is defined as EL(G)=$\sum$i$\lambda$i2, where $\lambda$i's are eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of weighted network G. The importance (centrality) of a vertex v is reflected by the drop of the Laplacian energy of the network to respond to the deactivation (deletion) of the vertex from the network. We also prove an algebraic graph theory result that provides a structural description of the Laplacian centrality measure which is in terms of the number of all kinds of 2-walks. Laplacian centrality unveils more structural information about connectivity and density around v (further than its immediate neighborhood). That is, comparing with other standard centrality measures proposed for weighted networks (e.g. degree, closeness or betweenness centrality), Laplacian centrality is an intermediate measuring between global and local characterization of the importance (centrality) of a vertex. We further investigate the validness and robustness of this new centrality measure by illustrating this method to some classical weighted social network data sets and obtain reliable results, which provide strong evidences of the new measure's utility.},

The suggested information distance diverges from the classical geodesic metric since it is sensible to all paths (not just to the shortest ones) and it diminishes as soon as there are more routes between a pair of nodes. Interestingly, information distance has a clear interpretation in electrical network theory that was missed by the proposing authors. When a fixed resistor is imagined on each edge of the graph, information distance, known as resistance distance in this context, corresponds to the effective resistance between two nodes when a battery is connected across them. Here, we review resistance distance, showing once again, with a simple proof, that it matches information distance. Hence, we interpret both current-flow closeness and current-flow betweenness centrality in terms of resistance distance. We show that this interpretation has semantic, theoretical, and computational benefits.},

  abstract = {Due to the significant increment of the volume of interactions among the population, probabilistic process on complex network can be often utilized to analyse diffusion phenomena in the society, then a number of researchers have studied especially from the perspectives of social network analysis, computer virus spread study, and epidemics study. So far, it has been believed that the largest eigenvalue and the principal eigenvector of the adjacency matrix can well approximate the dynamics on networks, but the accuracy of this approximation method has not study extensively. In our previous work, we found that not only the largest eigenvalue and the principle eigenvector but also the other eigenvalues and eigenvectors need to be considered when analysing the diffusion process on real networks. In this paper, we proposed a new centrality measure, the infection diffusion eigenvector centrality (IDEC), which considers all eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our comparison results indicates that the IDEC shows better predictability than other centrality measures when the effective infection ratio is low, which will provide us with a good insight for practical application for developing the effective infection prevention methodology. Also, another interesting finding is that the eigenvector centrality shows poor predictability especially on the real networks. In addition, we conduct the recovery probability enforcement simulation, which highlights the advantage of IDEC for the range below the critical point.},

With the amoeboid algorithm, each edge is endowed with a flux and edges on shorter paths are of greater flux. By defining flux as criticality of edges, Physarum centrality of a node can be easily calculated as summing up the criticality of edges attached to it.

Although centrality is a well-studied topic in social network analysis, and is one of the most widely used properties for studying affiliation networks, virtually all discussions of centrality and centralization have concerned themselves with one-mode networks. Bonacich's work on simultaneous group and individual centralities is a notable exception (Social Networks, 1991, 13, 155\textendash{}168). I begin by outlining the distinctive features of affiliation networks and describe four motivations for centrality indices in affiliation networks. I then consider properties of some existing centrality indices for affiliation networks, including the relationship between centralities for actors and events in these networks, and present a new conceptualization of centrality that builds on the formal properties of affiliation networks and captures important theoretical insights about the positions of actors and events in these networks. These centralities are then illustrated on Galaskiewicz's data on club and board memberships of a sample of corporate executive officers (Social Organization of an Urban Grants Economy. New York: Academic Press, 1985). The conclusion to this paper discusses strengths and weaknesses of centrality indices when applied to affiliation networks.},

We study eight real-world networks for which CS(i) displays useful and desirable properties, such as clear ranking of nodes and scale-free characteristics. Compared with the number of links per node, the ranking introduced by CS(i) (for the nodes in the protein interaction network of S. cereviciae) is more highly correlated with the lethality of individual proteins removed from the proteome.},

Betweenness is, in some sense, a measure of the influence a node has over the spread of information through the network. By counting only shortest paths, however, the conventional definition implicitly assumes that information spreads only along those shortest paths. Here, we propose a betweenness measure that relaxes this assumption, including contributions from essentially all paths between nodes, not just the shortest, although it still gives more weight to short paths. The measure is based on random walks, counting how often a node is traversed by a random walk between two other nodes. We show how our measure can be calculated using matrix methods, and give some examples of its application to particular networks.},

Considering the complexity of large-scale and dynamical topologies of many real-world networks, both PD and PB are computed with only the local topological structure of a path. We demonstrate the distribution of the three path centralities (TPC, PD and PB) in computer-generated networks and real-world networks. Furthermore, we apply the three path centralities to the network fragility problem, and exploit the distribution of the optimal control parameter $\beta$opt through simulation and analysis. Finally, the simulation results show that generally TPC is more efficient than PD and PB in the network fragility problem. These path centralities are also applicable in many other network problems including spread, control, prediction and so on.},

Centrality refers to the relative importance of a zone in terms of network efficiency and utility for both transportation and urban study. Centrality indices that were developed to describe human relationships in the field of structural sociology were adopted. It is important to accommodate the neighborhood effect in dealing with centrality. The neighborhood effect describes the phenomenon whereby the attractiveness of a specific zone is affected by its neighbor zones. Kernel functions were employed to accommodate the neighborhood effect. The optimal bandwidth parameters were derived indirectly within the framework of trip attraction estimation under the assumption that the trip attraction of a zone is influenced by the integrated centrality, which includes the neighborhood effect. The well-known estimation tool of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) was adopted to find the optimal bandwidth. As a byproduct of accommodating the neighborhood effect in centralities, a considerable advantage of the present study is an enhancement of the performance of trip attraction model. Another meaningful contribution of this study is a solution to the question of an acceptable delineation of the two city centers in Seoul. The boundaries of the two city centers were derived based on both the kernel function and its bandwidth.},

Community centrality is a novel concept that we introduce to describe how central one's community is within the whole network. We introduce an algorithm to estimate the distance between communities and use it to find the centrality of communities. Using data from several social networks, we show that central communities incorporate actors who are involved in mainstream activities for that network. We then conduct a detailed study of different social networks and determine how various global measures of prominence relate to structural centrality measures. We show that depending on the underlying measure of prominence, different combinations of local, global and community centrality play an important role in determining the prominence. Local and community centrality measures add new information on top of existing global measures. We show robustness of our results by studying different partitions of the data and different clustering methods. Our deconstruction of centrality allows us to study the underlying processes that contribute to prominence in more detail and develop more detailed and accurate models.},

  abstract = {We propose an efficient method to discover a new type of influential nodes in a social network, which we name ``super-mediators'', i.e., those nodes which, if removed, decrease information spread. It is formulated mathematically as a problem of difference maximization of the average influence degree with respect to removal of a node, i.e., a node that contributes to making the difference large is influential. This definition requires use of information diffusion model for their identification and thus is ``model-driven''. The other definition which is more empirical is that super-mediators are those nodes that appear frequently in long diffusion sequences but much less frequently in short diffusion sequences. This definition does not require any model but does require abundant information diffusion data and thus is ``data-driven''. We attempt to characterize the property of super-mediators from various angles: how the resulting super-mediators are different between these two definitions and which is more reasonable, how super-mediators are compared with nodes identified by other centralities, e.g., betweenness, degree, closeness, etc., how super mediators are different from the solution of well-studied influence maximization problem, i.e., nodes capable of widely spreading information to other recipient nodes, and the solution of reverse-influence maximization problem, i.e., nodes capable of widely receiving information from other information source nodes. We conducted extensive experiments using three real world social networks. The major findings are (1) model-driven super-mediator degree has the best discrimination capability, while influence degree, reverse-influence degree, and data-driven super-mediator degree are much less discriminative (all flat for high ranked nodes), (2) model-driven super-mediators have high scores for either influence degree or reverse-influence degree, while data-driven super-mediators have high scores for both, and (3) model-driven super-mediators are closely correlated with betweenness centrality, but the strength of the correlation depends on the value of diffusion probability.},

This centrality measure, that we call ranking-betweenness centrality, combines the idea behind the random-walk betweenness centrality measure and the idea of ranking the nodes of a network produced by an adapted PageRank algorithm. We initially use a PageRank algorithm in which we are able to transform some information of the network that we want to analyze into numerical values. Numerical values summarizing the information are associated to each of the nodes by means of a data matrix. After running the adapted PageRank algorithm, a ranking of the nodes is obtained, according to their importance in the network. This classification is the starting point for applying an algorithm based on the random-walk betweenness centrality. A detailed example of a real urban street network is discussed in order to understand the process to evaluate the ranking-betweenness centrality proposed, performing some comparisons with other classical centrality measures.},

Both Crossley and Bonacich contend that rather than its intrinsic wealth or value, an actor's status lies in the structures of its interactions with other actors. Since pairwise relation data in a network can be stored in a two-dimensional array or matrix, graph theory and linear algebra lend themselves as great tools to gauge the centrality (interpreted as importance, power, or popularity, depending on the purpose of the network) of each actor. We express known and new centralities in terms of only two matrices associated with the network. We show that derivations of these expressions can be handled exclusively through the main eigenvectors (not orthogonal to the all-one vector) associated with the adjacency matrix. We also propose a centrality vector (SWIPD) which is a linear combination of the square, walk, power, and degree centrality vectors with weightings of the various centralities depending on the purpose of the network. By comparing actors' scores for various weightings, a clear understanding of which actors are most central is obtained. Moreover, for threshold networks, the (SWIPD) measure turns out to be independent of the weightings.},

  abstract = {Betweenness measures provide quantitative tools to pick out fine details from the massive amount of interaction data that is available from large complex networks. They allow us to study the extent to which a node takes part when information is passed around the network. Nodes with high betweenness may be regarded as key players that have a highly active role. At one extreme, betweenness has been defined by considering information passing only through the shortest paths between pairs of nodes. At the other extreme, an alternative type of betweenness has been defined by considering all possible walks of any length. In this work, we propose a betweenness measure that lies between these two opposing viewpoints. We allow information to pass through all possible routes, but introduce a scaling so that longer walks carry less importance. This new definition shares a similar philosophy to that of communicability for pairs of nodes in a network, which was introduced by Estrada and Hatano [E. Estrada, N. Hatano, Phys. Rev. E 77 (2008) 036111]. Having defined this new communicability betweenness measure, we show that it can be characterized neatly in terms of the exponential of the adjacency matrix. We also show that this measure is closely related to a Fr\'echet derivative of the matrix exponential. This allows us to conclude that it also describes network sensitivity when the edges of a given node are subject to infinitesimally small perturbations. Using illustrative synthetic and real life networks, we show that the new betweenness measure behaves differently to existing versions, and in particular we show that it recovers meaningful biological information from a protein\textendash{}protein interaction network.},

  abstract = {Identifying influential nodes in very large-scale directed networks is a big challenge relevant to disparate applications, such as accelerating information propagation, controlling rumors and diseases, designing search engines, and understanding hierarchical organization of social and biological networks. Known methods range from node centralities, such as degree, closeness and betweenness, to diffusion-based processes, like PageRank and LeaderRank. Some of these methods already take into account the influences of a node's neighbors but do not directly make use of the interactions among it's neighbors. Local clustering is known to have negative impacts on the information spreading. We further show empirically that it also plays a negative role in generating local connections. Inspired by these facts, we propose a local ranking algorithm named ClusterRank, which takes into account not only the number of neighbors and the neighbors' influences, but also the clustering coefficient. Subject to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading model with constant infectivity, experimental results on two directed networks, a social network extracted from delicious.com and a large-scale short-message communication network, demonstrate that the ClusterRank outperforms some benchmark algorithms such as PageRank and LeaderRank. Furthermore, ClusterRank can also be applied to undirected networks where the superiority of ClusterRank is significant compared with degree centrality and k-core decomposition. In addition, ClusterRank, only making use of local information, is much more efficient than global methods: It takes only 191 seconds for a network with about  nodes, more than 15 times faster than PageRank.},

  abstract = {This work introduces a new family of link-based dissimilarity measures between nodes of a weighted directed graph. This measure, called the randomized shortest-path (RSP) dissimilarity, depends on a parameter \texttheta{} and has the interesting property of reducing, on one end, to the standard shortest-path distance when \texttheta{} is large and, on the other end, to the commute-time (or resistance) distance when \texttheta{} is small (near zero). Intuitively, it corresponds to the expected cost incurred by a random walker in order to reach a destination node from a starting node while maintaining a constant entropy (related to \texttheta{}) spread in the graph. The parameter \texttheta{} is therefore biasing gradually the simple random walk on the graph towards the shortest-path policy. By adopting a statistical physics approach and computing a sum over all the possible paths (discrete path integral), it is shown that the RSP dissimilarity from every node to a particular node of interest can be computed efficiently by solving two linear systems of n equations, where n is the number of nodes. On the other hand, the dissimilarity between every couple of nodes is obtained by inverting an n x n matrix. The proposed measure can be used for various graph mining tasks such as computing betweenness centrality, finding dense communities, etc, as shown in the experimental section.},

The framework defines Boltzmann probability distributions over paths of the network which focus on the shortest paths, but also take into account longer paths depending on an inverse temperature parameter. RSP's have previously proven to be useful in defining distance measures on networks. In this work we study their utility in quantifying the importance of the nodes of a network. The proposed RSP betweenness centralities combine, in an optimal way, the ideas of using the shortest and purely random paths for analysing the roles of network nodes, avoiding issues involving these two paradigms. We present the derivations of these measures and how they can be computed in an efficient way. In addition, we show with real world examples the potential of the RSP betweenness centralities in identifying interesting nodes of a network that more traditional methods might fail to notice.},

The need for developing such distances has risen from the observation that the above-mentioned common distances in many situations fail to take into account the global structure of the graph. In this article, we develop the theory of one family of graph node distances, known as the randomized shortest path dissimilarity, which has its foundation in statistical physics. We show that the randomized shortest path dissimilarity can be easily computed in closed form for all pairs of nodes of a graph. Moreover, we come up with a new definition of a distance measure that we call the free energy distance. The free energy distance can be seen as an upgrade of the randomized shortest path dissimilarity as it defines a metric, in addition to which it satisfies the graph-geodetic property. The derivation and computation of the free energy distance are also straightforward. We then make a comparison between a set of generalized distances that interpolate between the shortest path distance and the commute time, or resistance distance. This comparison focuses on the applicability of the distances in graph node clustering and classification. The comparison, in general, shows that the parametrized distances perform well in the tasks. In particular, we see that the results obtained with the free energy distance are among the best in all the experiments.},

  abstract = {This letter addresses the problem of designing the transition probabilities of a finite Markov chain (the policy) in order to minimize the expected cost for reaching a destination node from a source node while maintaining a fixed level of entropy spread throughout the network (the exploration). It is motivated by the following scenario. Suppose you have to route agents through a network in some optimal way, for instance, by minimizing the total travel cost\textemdash{}nothing particular up to now\textemdash{}you could use a standard shortest-path algorithm. Suppose, however, that you want to avoid pure deterministic routing policies in order, for instance, to allow some continual exploration of the network, avoid congestion, or avoid complete predictability of your routing strategy. In other words, you want to introduce some randomness or unpredictability in the routing policy (i.e., the routing policy is randomized). This problem, which will be called the randomized shortest-path problem (RSP), is investigated in this work. The global level of randomness of the routing policy is quantified by the expected Shannon entropy spread throughout the network and is provided a priori by the designer. Then, necessary conditions to compute the optimal randomized policy\textemdash{}minimizing the expected routing cost\textemdash{}are derived. Iterating these necessary conditions, reminiscent of Bellman's value iteration equations, allows computing an optimal policy, that is, a set of transition probabilities in each node. Interestingly and surprisingly enough, this first model, while formulated in a totally different framework, is equivalent to Akamatsu's model (1996), appearing in transportation science, for a special choice of the entropy constraint. We therefore revisit Akamatsu's model by recasting it into a sum-over-paths statistical physics formalism allowing easy derivation of all the quantities of interest in an elegant, unified way. For instance, it is shown that the unique optimal policy can be obtained by solving a simple linear system of equations. This second model is therefore more convincing because of its computational efficiency and soundness. Finally, simulation results obtained on simple, illustrative examples show that the models behave as expected.},

  abstract = {We study a problem of data packet transport in scale-free networks whose degree distribution follows a power law with the exponent $\gamma$. Load, or ``betweenness centrality,'' of a vertex is the accumulated total number of data packets passing through that vertex when every pair of vertices sends and receives a data packet along the shortest path connecting the pair. It is found that the load distribution follows a power law with the exponent $\delta\approx$2.2(1), insensitive to different values of $\gamma$ in the range, 2$<\gamma\leq$3, and different mean degrees, which is valid for both undirected and directed cases. Thus, we conjecture that the load exponent is a universal quantity to characterize scale-free networks.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the criticality of individual components of power systems is essential for overall reliability and management. This paper proposes an AC-based power flow element importance measure, while considering multi-element failures. The measure relies on a proposed AC-based cascading failure model, which captures branch overflow, bus load shedding, and branch failures, via AC power flow and optimal power flow analyses. Taking the IEEE 30, 57 and 118-bus power systems as case studies, we find that N-3 analyses are sufficient to measure the importance of a bus or branch. It is observed that for a substation bus, its importance is statistically proportional to its power demand, but this trend is not observed for power plant buses. While comparing with other reliability, functionality, and topology-based importance measures popular today, we find that a DC power flow model, although better correlated with the benchmark AC model as a whole, still fails to locate some critical elements. This is due to the focus of DC-based models on real power that ignores reactive power. The proposed importance measure is aimed to inform decision makers about key components in complex systems, while improving cascading failure prevention, system backup setting, and overall resilience.},

Although detecting these influential nodes based on their friendship relationships is studied a lot, finding important nodes using users' behavior and activates has not attracted much attention. In this work, we study users' importance in various Facebook activity networks including like, comment, post, share, and mixed, then compare gained rankings with those of the friendship network and conclude that users influence analysis in activity networks represents very different results. Afterwards, we propose new centrality measures that can present different rankings suitable for different applications, further to have the potential for simultaneous consideration of various activities in a multilayer network. Experimental results highlights the benefits of using the presented methods. To the best of our knowledge, our methods are the first and only proposed centrality measures that can present different rankings for various applications based on users' social behavior.},

However, these studies focus only on a centrality measure and each centrality measure has its own shortcomings and limitations. To solve the above problems, in this paper, a novel method is proposed to identify influential nodes based on combining of the existing centrality measures. Because information flow spreads in different ways in different networks, in the specific network, the appropriate centrality measures should be selected to calculate the ranking of nodes. Then, an interval can be generated for the ranking of each node, which includes the upper limit and lower limit obtained from different centrality measures. Next, the final ranking of each node can be determined based on the median of the interval. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, four experiments are conducted to identify vital nodes simulations on four real networks, and the superiority of the method can be demonstrated by the results of comparison experiments.},

Usually, betweenness centrality (BC) is used to evaluate a node capacity to connect different graph regions. However, we argue here that this measure is not adapted for that task, as it gives equal weight to `local' centres (i.e. nodes of high-degree central to a single region) and to `global' bridges, which connect different communities. This distinction is important as the roles of such nodes are different in terms of the local and global organization of the network structure. In this paper, we propose a decomposition of BC into two terms, one highlighting the local contributions and the other the global ones. We call the latter bridgeness centrality and show that it is capable to specifically spot out global bridges. In addition, we introduce an effective algorithmic implementation of this measure and demonstrate its capability to identify global bridges in air transportation and scientific collaboration networks.},

  abstract = {Summary form only given. Strong light-matter coupling has been recently successfully explored in the GHz and THz [1] range with on-chip platforms. New and intriguing quantum optical phenomena have been predicted in the ultrastrong coupling regime [2], when the coupling strength $\Omega$ becomes comparable to the unperturbed frequency of the system $\omega$. We recently proposed a new experimental platform where we couple the inter-Landau level transition of an high-mobility 2DEG to the highly subwavelength photonic mode of an LC meta-atom [3] showing very large $\Omega$/$\omega$c = 0.87. Our system benefits from the collective enhancement of the light-matter coupling which comes from the scaling of the coupling $\Omega$ $\propto$ $\surd$n, were n is the number of optically active electrons. In our previous experiments [3] and in literature [4] this number varies from 104-103 electrons per meta-atom. We now engineer a new cavity, resonant at 290 GHz, with an extremely reduced effective mode surface Seff = 4 \texttimes{} 10-14 m2 (FE simulations, CST), yielding large field enhancements above 1500 and allowing to enter the few ($<$;100) electron regime. It consist of a complementary metasurface with two very sharp metallic tips separated by a 60 nm gap (Fig.1(a, b)) on top of a single triangular quantum well. THz-TDS transmission experiments as a function of the applied magnetic field reveal strong anticrossing of the cavity mode with linear cyclotron dispersion. Measurements for arrays of only 12 cavities are reported in Fig.1(c). On the top horizontal axis we report the number of electrons occupying the topmost Landau level as a function of the magnetic field. At the anticrossing field of B=0.73 T we measure approximately 60 electrons ultra strongly coupled ($\Omega$/$\omega$- ||},

Identifying users in these two classes is important for abuse detection, user and content ranking, privacy choices, and other social network features. In this paper we develop SCRank, an iterative algorithm to identify such users. We analyze SCRank both theoretically and experimentally. The spammer-celebrity definition is not amenable to analysis using standard power iteration, so we develop a novel potential function argument to show convergence to an approximate equilibrium point for a class of algorithms including SCRank. We then use experimental evaluation on a real global-scale social network and on synthetically generated graphs to observe that the algorithm converges quickly and consistently. Using synthetic data with built-in ground truth, we also experimentally show that the algorithm provides a good approximation to planted celebrities and spammers.},

Thus the concept "point centrality," as employed in this paper, follows Bavelas' (1950) conceptualization of the problem and applies to the relative position of each point in a network rather than to an overall summary indexing the entire network. An approach to analyzing social networks within empirical social organizations is presented whereby a rank ordering as to the relative centrality of each point (point-centrality) can be approximated for each point in the social unit regardless of whether or not they are all part of a single connected network.

  abstract = {Identifying the most influential spreaders with the aim of reaching a maximum spreading ability has been a challenging and crucial topic so far. Many centrality measures have been proposed to identify the importance of nodes in spreader detection process. Centrality measures are used to rank the spreading power of nodes. These centralities belong to either local, semi-local, or global category. Local centralities have accuracy problem and global measures need a higher time complexity that are inefficient for large-scale networks. In contrast, semi-local measures are popular methods that have high accuracy and near-linear time complexity. In this paper, we have proposed a new semi-local and free-parameter centrality measure by applying the natural characteristics of complex networks. The proposed centrality can assign higher ranks for structural holes as better spreaders in the network. It uses the positive effects of second-level neighbors' clustering coefficient and negative effects of node's clustering coefficient in defining the importance of nodes. Therefore, the proposed centrality avoids selection of spreaders that are too close to one another. We compare the proposed method with different centrality measures based on Susceptible\textendash{}Infected\textendash{}Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible\textendash{}Infected (SI) models on both artificial and real-world networks. Experiments on both artificial and real networks show that our method has its competitive advantages over the other compared centralities.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new centrality index for bipartite networks of papers and authors that we call K-index. The K-index grows with the citation performance of the papers that cite a given researcher and can be seen as a measure of scientific social recognition. Indeed, the K-index measures the number of hubs, defined in a self-consistent way in the bipartite network, that cites a given author. We show that the K-index can be computed by simple inspection of the Web of Science platform and presents several advantages over other centrality indexes, in particular Hirsch h-index. The K-index is robust to self-citations, is not limited by the total number of papers published by a researcher as occurs for the h-index and can distinguish in a consistent way researchers that have the same h-index but very different scientific social recognition. The K-index easily detects a known case of a researcher with inflated number of papers, citations and h-index due to scientific misconduct. Finally, we show that, in a sample of twenty-eight physics Nobel laureates and twenty-eight highly cited non-Nobel-laureate physicists, the K-index correlates better to the achievement of the prize than the number of papers, citations, citations per paper, citing articles or the h-index. Clustering researchers in a K versus h plot reveals interesting outliers that suggest that these two indexes can present complementary independent information.},

  abstract = {Ranking nodes in complex networks have become an important task in many application domains. In a complex network, influential nodes are those that have the most spreading ability. Thus, identifying influential nodes based on their spreading ability is a fundamental task in different applications such as viral marketing. One of the most important centrality measures to ranking nodes is closeness centrality which is efficient but suffers from high computational complexity O(n3). This paper tries to improve closeness centrality by utilizing the local structure of nodes and presents a new ranking algorithm, called BridgeRank centrality. The proposed method computes local centrality value for each node. For this purpose, at first, communities are detected and the relationship between communities is completely ignored. Then, by applying a centrality in each community, only one best critical node from each community is extracted. Finally, the nodes are ranked based on computing the sum of the shortest path length of nodes to obtained critical nodes. We have also modified the proposed method by weighting the original BridgeRank and selecting several nodes from each community based on the density of that community. Our method can find the best nodes with high spread ability and low time complexity, which make it applicable to large-scale networks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we use the SIR diffusion model. Finally, experiments on real and artificial networks show that our method is able to identify influential nodes so efficiently, and achieves better performance compared to other recent methods.},

  abstract = {Betweenness centrality is one of the basic concepts in the analysis of social networks. Initial definition for the betweenness of a node in a graph is based on the fraction of the number of geodesics (shortest paths) between any two nodes that given node lies on, to the total number of the shortest paths connecting these nodes. This method has quadratic complexity and does not take into account indirect paths. We propose a new concept of betweenness centrality for weighted network, beta current flow centrality, based on Kirchhoff's law for electric circuits. In comparison with the original current flow centrality and alpha current flow centrality, this new measure can be computed for larger networks. The results of numerical experiments for some examples of networks, in particular, for the popular social network VKontakte as well as the comparison with PageRank method are presented.},

  abstract = {The most important political processes in Mexican politics including presidential succession since the 1920s have been conducted within a network whose political rationale has been political stability. All presidential elections have been won by a single political party. We analyzed the role of the network and presidential successions measuring significant relationships using the system UCINET IV. We contrasted computer distributions with historical facts. Applying the structural block model algorithm we found two well differentiated sub-networks, one representing a military-based group and the second a financial-based group. Measuring the network's centrality is one of the main objectives of network analysis for understanding concentrations of power and the distribution of influence in the political system. In this article we evaluate the maximum node and clique network index value concentration for the core of the Mexican network of power. Centrality and power indexes in the network are presented and their results are discussed in connection with cohesiveness.},

  abstract = {A variety of node-level centrality measures, including purely structural measures (such as degree and closeness centrality) and measures incorporating characteristics of actors (such as the Blau's measure of heterogeneity) have been developed to measure a person's access to resources held by others. Each of these node-level measures can be placed on a continuum depending on whether they focus only on ego's direct contacts (e.g. degree centrality and Blau's measure of heterogeneity), or whether they also incorporate connections to others at longer distances in the network (e.g. closeness centrality or betweenness centrality). In this paper we propose generalized measures, where a tuning parameter $\delta$ regulates the relative impact of resources held by more close versus more distant others. We first show how, when a specific $\delta$ is chosen degree-centrality and reciprocal closeness centrality are two specific instances of this more general measure. We then demonstrate how a similar approach can be applied to node-level measures that incorporate attributes. When more or less weight is given to other nodes at longer distances with specific characteristics, a generalized measure of resource-richness and a generalized measure for diversity among one's connections can be obtained (following Blau's measure of heterogeneity). Finally, we show how this approach can also be applied to betweenness centrality to focus on more local (ego) betweenness or global (Freeman) betweenness. The importance of the choice of $\delta$ is illustrated on some classic network datasets.},
